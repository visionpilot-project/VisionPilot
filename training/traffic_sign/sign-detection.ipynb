This treats all traffic sign types as a single \"Traffic Sign\" class. This significantly improves detection performance (recall/precision) because the model focuses solely on distinguishing signs from background (houses, trees, etc.) without getting confused by class variations. Classification is handled by a separate model in the pipeline.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n1.  **Datasets:** Ensure you have added your datasets (DFG, BelgiumTSC) to the Kaggle notebook. They should appear under `/kaggle/input`.\n2.  **GPU:** Make sure to turn on the GPU accelerator in the Kaggle notebook settings.\n","metadata":{}},{"id":"e5135a38","cell_type":"code","source":"!pip
