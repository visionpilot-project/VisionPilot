A modular Python project for autonomous driving research and prototyping, fully integrated with the BeamNG.tech simulator and Foxglove visualization. This system combines traditional computer vision and state-of-the-art deep learning (CNN, U-Net, YOLO, SCNN) with real-time sensor fusion and autonomous vehicle control to tackle:

- Lane detection (Traditional CV, SCNN, capable of city & highway scenarios)
- Traffic sign classification & detection (CNN, YOLOv8)
- Traffic light detection & classification (YOLOv8, CV, CNN)
- Vehicle & pedestrian detection and recognition (YOLOv8)
- Multi-sensor fusion (Camera, LiDAR, Radar)
- Multi-model inference, real-time simulation, autonomous driving with PID control (BeamNG.tech)
- Real-time visualization and monitoring (Foxglove WebSocket)

Features robust training pipelines, modular sensor integration, multi-model inference, and a flexible folder structure for easy experimentation and extension. The project is designed for research and prototyping in realistic driving environments using BeamNG.tech with professional-grade visualization through Foxglove.

## Quickstart & Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

2. **Configure simulation (Optional):**
  Edit configuration files in `beamng_sim/config/`:
  - `beamng_sim.yaml` - BeamNG host, port, and vehicle settings
  - `scenarios.yaml` - Available scenarios
  - `sensors.yaml` - Sensor parameters (camera, LiDAR, radar)
  - `control.yaml` - PID tuning and vehicle control parameters
  
  See `beamng_sim/config/README.md` for detailed parameter descriptions.

3. **Run the simulation:**
  ```bash
  python -m beamng_sim.beamng
  ```
  - Make sure BeamNG.tech is installed, running, and properly licensed. See [BeamNG.tech documentation](https://www.beamng.tech/) for setup.
  - Foxglove visualization will be available at `ws://localhost:8765`

4. **View real-time visualization:**
  - Open [Foxglove Studio](https://app.foxglove.dev/)
  - Connect to WebSocket server: `ws://localhost:8765`
  - Load the provided Foxglove layout or create your own

  > **Important:** You must ensure that all required models (e.g., trained weights, .h5/.pt files) and configuration files are placed in the correct directories as expected by the code. The folder structure shown below must be followed, and missing files or incorrect paths will cause errors. See each module's README or script comments for details on required files and their locations.
