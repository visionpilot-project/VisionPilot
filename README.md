## Overview

A modular Python project for autonomous driving research and prototyping, fully integrated with the BeamNG.tech simulator and Foxglove visualization. This system combines traditional computer vision and state-of-the-art deep learning (CNN, U-Net, YOLO, SCNN) with real-time sensor fusion and autonomous vehicle control to tackle:

- Lane detection (Traditional CV, SCNN, capable of city & highway scenarios)
- Traffic sign classification & detection (CNN, YOLOv8)
- Traffic light detection & classification (YOLOv8, CV, CNN)
- Vehicle & pedestrian detection and recognition (YOLOv8)
- Multi-sensor fusion (Camera, LiDAR, Radar)
- Multi-model inference, real-time simulation, autonomous driving with PID control (BeamNG.tech)
- Real-time visualization and monitoring (Foxglove WebSocket)

Features robust training pipelines, modular sensor integration, multi-model inference, and a flexible folder structure for easy experimentation and extension. The project is designed for research and prototyping in realistic driving environments using BeamNG.tech with professional-grade visualization through Foxglove.

## Demos

### Pure Sign Detection & Detection and classification of vehicles and pedestrians Demo

This demo shows real-time traffic sign detection (no classification) as well as vehicle and pedestrian on a video:

![Sign Detection Demo & Vehicle Pedestrian](images/traffic-sign-classification/sign_detection_demo.gif)

> Only detection is shown; classification is not included in this demo.

## Traffic Light Detection & Classification Demo

This demo shows real-time traffic light detection and classification on a video:

![Traffic Light Detection & Classification Demo](images/traffic-lights/traffic_light_demo.gif)

> Both detection and classification are shown in this demo.

### Latest Lane Detection Demo (v2)

Watch the improved autonomous lane keeping demo (v2) in BeamNG.tech, featuring smoother fused CV+SCNN lane detection, stable PID steering, and robust adaptive cruise control:

[![Autonomous Lane Keeping v2 Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7eA_XfIkLWQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eA_XfIkLWQ)

Watch on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eA_XfIkLWQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eA_XfIkLWQ)

This v2 demo shows:
- Autonomous lane keeping with tuned PID steering (stable, minimal oscillation)
- Fused CV & SCNN lane detection (smoother, more robust)
- Adaptive cruise control (ACC) holding ~50 km/h
- Handles shadows, bridges, and recovers from distractions
- Real-time visualization and multi-model inference

> Note: Very low-light (tunnel) scenarios are not yet supported.
