![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Julian1777/self-driving-project?style=social)


A modular Python project for autonomous driving research and prototyping, now fully integrated with the BeamNG.tech simulator. This system combines traditional computer vision and state-of-the-art deep learning (CNN, U-Net, YOLO, SCNN) to tackle:

- 🛣️ Lane detection (Hough Transform, SCNN, city/highway scenarios)
- 🛑 Traffic sign classification & detection (CNN, YOLOv8, GTRSB, LISA, Mapillary)
- 🚦 Traffic light detection & classification (YOLOv8, DLDT, LISA)
- 🚗 Vehicle & pedestrian detection and recognition (YOLOv8, SCNN, BDD100K)
- 🧠 Multi-model inference, real-time simulation, and visualization (BeamNG.tech)

Features robust training pipelines, multi-model inference, and a flexible folder structure for easy experimentation and extension. The project is designed for research and prototyping in realistic driving environments using BeamNG.tech.

  - Place GTSRB Dataset in the appropriate subfolder
- **Traffic Sign Detection:**
  - Place unprocessed Mapillary Sign Dataset in `datasets/traffic-sign/raw`
  - Processed dataset for yolov8 format in `datasets/traffic-sign/processed-yolo/`

## 📊 Results

For qualitative and quantitative results, see the demo section above and the `results/` folder for visualizations, metrics, and sample outputs. Example outputs include:

  - `results/traffic-sign-classification/metrics/` (JSON, curves)
  - `results/traffic-sign-detection/weights/` (YOLO checkpoints)
  - `results/vehicle-pedestrian/visualizations/` (confusion matrices, sample batches)


## ⚡ Quickstart & Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
2. **Run a demo (BeamNG.tech):**
  ```bash
  python beamng_sim/beamng.py
  ```
  - Make sure you have BeamNG.tech installed and properly licensed. See [BeamNG.tech documentation](https://www.beamng.tech/) for setup instructions.

> **Important:** You must ensure that all required models (e.g., trained weights, .h5/.pt files) and configuration files are placed in the correct directories as expected by the code. The folder structure shown below must be followed, and missing files or incorrect paths will cause errors. See each module's README or script comments for details on required files and their locations.

3. **Train a model:**
  See notebooks or scripts in each module folder.

  > **Note:** You must download and prepare the required datasets yourself (e.g., sorting, cropping, formatting, or converting to the expected structure) as described in each module's documentation or script. The code will not work without properly prepared data.
