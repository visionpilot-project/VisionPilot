## Overview

A modular Python project for autonomous driving research and prototyping, fully integrated with the BeamNG.tech simulator and Foxglove visualization. This system combines traditional computer vision algorithms and deep learning (CNN, UFLD) with real-time sensor fusion and autonomous vehicle control to tackle:

- **Multi-Lane Detection**: UFLD, Traditional CV
- **Traffic Sign**: Classification & Detection
- **Traffic Lights**: Classification & Detection
- **Multi-Class Object Detection**: Vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and more
- **Multi-Sensor Fusion**: Camera, Lidar, Radar, GPS, IMU<!-- - **Microservices Architecture**: Containerized multi-model inference (Docker), orchestrated via central aggregator -->
- **Real-Time Control**: PID steering, cruise control (CC), automatic emergency braking (AEB)
- **Visualization**: Real-time monitoring with Foxglove WebSocket + multiple CV windows
- **Configuration System**: YAML-based modular settings
  
> **Looking Ahead**: While VisionPilot currently runs on BeamNG.tech, integration with the **CARLA Simulator** is planned on our roadmap. If you are interested in helping build the CARLA bridge, PRs are welcome and much appreciated!

## Usage

### 1. Download BeamNG.tech

First, download and install BeamNG.tech from the [official website](https://www.beamng.tech/). This is required to run the simulation environment.

### 2. Configure BeamNG Path

Navigate to the `config` directory and update the path to your BeamNG.tech installation in the configuration files.

**Configuration Files Overview:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **beamng.yaml** | Main configuration file containing the path to your BeamNG.tech installation. **Required for basic setup** |
| **config.py** | Python configuration module that loads and manages all YAML settings |
| **control.yaml** | Steering, throttle, and braking control parameters (PID tuning) |
| **perception.yaml** | Computer vision pipeline settings (lane detection, object detection thresholds) |
| **scenarios.yaml** | Simulation scenario definitions and test environments |
| **sensors.yaml** | Sensor configuration (camera, LiDAR, radar parameters) |

Update **`beamng.yaml`** with your BeamNG.tech installation path. For basic usage, this is the only essential configuration file you need to modify. Advanced users can also customize `sensors.yaml` to adjust sensor parameters.

### 3. Download Pretrained Models

Download the pretrained models for object detection, traffic light detection, traffic sign detection, and classification from the **[VisionPilot v0.1.0-alpha Release](https://github.com/visionpilot-project/VisionPilot/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha)**. Extract the downloaded model package into the `models` root folder with the following structure:

> **Note:** Pretrained models are provided with the **v0.1.0-alpha release**. Download the `visionpilot-v0.1.0-models.zip` package from the release assets and extract its contents into the `models` folder.

```text
models/
├── object_detection/
│   └── object_detection.pt
├── traffic_light/
│   └── traffic_light_detection.pt
├── traffic_sign/
│   ├── traffic_sign_detection.pt
│   └── traffic_sign_classification.h5
└── ufld/
    └── ufld_culane_res18.pth
```
### 4. Specify Model Paths

Verify that the model loading section in your main script matches your model directory structure:

```python
print("[Main] Loading local models...")
local_models = {}
local_models['vehicle'] = YOLO('models/object_detection/object_detection.pt')
local_models['traffic_light'] = YOLO('models/traffic_light/traffic_light_detection.pt')
local_models['sign_detect'] = YOLO('models/traffic_sign/traffic_sign_detection.pt')
local_models['sign_classify'] = load_model('models/traffic_sign/traffic_sign_classification.h5')
```

Update these paths if your model structure differs from the default.

#### UFLD Lane Detection Model

VisionPilot includes the required UFLDv2 code and configuration files. No separate UFLDv2 repository is required.

In `src/perception/lane_detection/main.py`, verify:

```python
model_path = MODELS_DIR / "ufld" / "ufld_culane_res18.pth"
```
Ensure the `ufld_culane_res18.pth` model weights are available before running the simulation.

### 5. Start the Simulation

Navigate to the `scripts` directory and run the startup script:

Linux/macOS:

```bash
cd scripts
./start_simulation.sh
```

Windows Powershell:
```bash
cd scripts
start_simulation.bat
```

The simulation will initialize BeamNG.tech, load the perception models, and begin streaming sensor data and AI predictions in real-time.

## Sensor Suite

The vehicle is equipped with a comprehensive multi-sensor suite for autonomous perception and control:

| Sensor                      | Specification                                        | Purpose                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Front Camera**            | 1920x1080 @ 50Hz, 70° FOV, Depth enabled             | Lane detection, traffic signs, traffic lights, object detection |
| **LiDAR (Top)**             | 80 vertical lines, 360° horizontal, 120m range, 20Hz | Obstacle detection, 3D scene understanding                      |

## Microservices Architecture

> **Note:** The microservices architecture is documented below as the intended design. **Currently, for active development and rapid iteration, all perception models run locally in-process** (bypassing Docker containers and the aggregator). This allows faster prototyping and validation of the complete pipeline. The containerized microservices will be re-integrated once the core perception, sensor fusion, and control systems are finalized and validated.

VisionPilot is designed to use a **containerized microservices architecture** where each perception task runs as an independent Flask service, orchestrated by a central Aggregator:

### Service Stack (Intended Design)

| Service | Port | Function | Model/Framework |
|---------|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Object Detection** | 5777 | Vehicle, pedestrian, cyclist detection | YOLOv11 |
| **Traffic Light Detection** | 6777 | Traffic light detection & state classification | YOLOv11 |
| **Sign Detection** | 7777 | Traffic sign detection | YOLOv11 |
| **Sign Classification** | 8777 | Traffic sign type classification | CNN |
| **YOLOP** | 9777 | Unified: lanes + drivable area + objects | YOLOPX |

### Data Flow

```
BeamNG Simulation Loop
    ↓
PerceptionClient.process_frame()
    ↓
Aggregator (concurrent orchestration)
    ├─→ Object Detection (5777)
    ├─→ Traffic Light (6777)
    ├─→ Sign Detection (7777)
    ├─→ Sign Classification (8777)
    └─→ YOLOP (9777)
    ↓
Merge all responses
    ↓
Return unified AggregationResult
    ↓
Extract individual results + visualize
```

### Benefits

**Concurrency**: All services run in parallel (ThreadPoolExecutor)  
**Modularity**: Add/remove services without modifying BeamNG code  
**Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling with container orchestration  
**Fault Tolerance**: Individual service failures don't break the pipeline  
**Reusability**: Services can be used independently or together
