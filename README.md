A modular Python project for autonomous driving research and prototyping, fully integrated with the BeamNG.tech simulator and Foxglove visualization. This system combines traditional computer vision and state-of-the-art deep learning (CNN, U-Net, YOLO, SCNN) with real-time sensor fusion and autonomous vehicle control to tackle:

- Lane detection (Traditional CV, SCNN, capable of city & highway scenarios)
- Traffic sign classification & detection (CNN, YOLOv8)
- Traffic light detection & classification (YOLOv8, CV, CNN)
- Vehicle & pedestrian detection and recognition (YOLOv8)
- Multi-sensor fusion (Camera, LiDAR, Radar)
- Multi-model inference, real-time simulation, autonomous driving with PID control (BeamNG.tech)
- Real-time visualization and monitoring (Foxglove WebSocket)

Features robust training pipelines, modular sensor integration, multi-model inference, and a flexible folder structure for easy experimentation and extension. The project is designed for research and prototyping in realistic driving environments using BeamNG.tech with professional-grade visualization through Foxglove.
