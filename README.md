![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Julian1777/self-driving-project?style=social)

A modular Python project for autonomous driving research and prototyping. This system combines traditional computer vision and state-of-the-art deep learning (CNN, U-Net, YOLO, SCNN) to tackle:

- 🛣️ Lane detection (Hough Transform, SCNN, city/highway scenarios)
- 🛑 Traffic sign classification & detection (CNN, YOLOv8, GTRSB, LISA, Mapillary)
- 🚦 Traffic light detection & classification (YOLOv8, DLDT, LISA)
- 🚗 Vehicle & pedestrian detection and recognition (YOLOv8, SCNN, BDD100K)
- 🧠 Multi-model inference, real-time simulation, and visualization (CARLA, Tkinter)

Features robust training pipelines, multi-model inference, and a flexible folder structure for easy experimentation and extension.
